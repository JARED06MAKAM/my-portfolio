            <h2>The Kahawa West Roots</h2>
            <p>My story begins in <strong>Kahawa West, Nairobi</strong>. This environment instilled in me a sense of community and resilience. From a young age, I was fascinated by the logic of numbers and how they could describe the world around us.</p>
            
            <h3>Mathematical Foundation</h3>
            <p>During my time at Kahawa Garrison, I emerged as a leader in Mathematics. I represented my school in numerous <strong>Mathematics Contests</strong>, attaining certificates of excellence that proved my ability to think critically under pressure. These experiences were the catalyst for my journey into Software Engineering—teaching me that every problem has a logical solution.</p>
